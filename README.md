# Vishnu Bot

- The brief idea of this project is to use the power of Telegram bots for the convenience of students at my institution


- The bot uses the following technologies

    - MongoDB Atlas as the backend for storing the student names.

    - [Nightmare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nightmare) as the web automater, the usage here is to capture the screenshot from the ECAP website.

    - [Chuck Norris API](https://api.chucknorris.io) to fetch some nice  chuck norris's jokes for you to laugh.
